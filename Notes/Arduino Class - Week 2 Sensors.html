</table><h2 id="analog-sensors">Analog Sensors</h2>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Analog Sensors can be powered to send an analog signal to a microcontroller or even be used directly in a circuit.<br>
Examples of analog changing sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photoresistor - uses light to control the resistance in a circuit.</li>
<li>Capacitive - Measure the capacitance on a surface that touches it. Very commonly used with cell phone screens and touch sensitive buttons. Some have the ability to output more or less voltage depending on the touch strength.</li>
<li>Thermistor - uses a temperature difference to change the resistance within a circuit.<br>
Examples of analog output sensors:</li>
<li>Many Accelerometers - Creates an analog signal depending on their speed of movement.</li>
<li>Many Gyroscopes - Creates an analog signal depending on rotation in a 2d field.</li>
<li>Microphone - Creates a voltage from the movement of a suspended membrane and magnetic fields.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digital">Digital</h2>
<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>Digital sensors only output boolean values (High and Low). As such digital sensors are technically only switches.<br>
Examples of Digital Sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tilt switch - Uses mercury to bridge two contacts and complete a eletrical circuit.</li>
<li>A standard switch/ button - Allows electrons to flow through the circuit when activated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-do-we-care">Why do we care</h3>
<p>Digital IO can be used to send and receive serialized and Paralleled data. This will be used on a vast majority of our sensors.<br>
Data IO can use many different standards. We’ll be looking at I2C,  SPI, and Parallel.</p>
<h3 id="parallel">Parallel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simpler than Serial.</li>
<li>Uses one line per bit of data that needs to be sent/received.</li>
<li>No real limit on bits as long as the microcontroller can handle the data.</li>
<li>Not used much any more.</li>
<li>Can get around IO limit by using shift registers.</li>
<li>Does not require a clock signal to keep the sender and receiver in sync.</li>
</ul>

<p>Addressing and storing bits with an arduino. (Can also be used to Read EEPROM chips for items like Gameboys and such.)</p>

<p>As an aside this guy does a lot of computer logic and showing how the low level logic works. It’s a great watch.</p>
<h4 id="serial-data">Serial Data</h4>
<ul>
<li>More complex than parallel.</li>
<li>Amount of lines varies depending on standard.
<ul>
<li>I2C requires one line for data.</li>
<li>SPI requires 2 for data. One for transmission, one for receive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can daisy chain multiple components</li>
<li>Widely supported on most digital components.</li>
<li>Requires a clock signal to keep components and microcontroller in sync.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data Transmission over 2 wires. One clock and one data.</p>

<h3 id="spi">SPI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimum of four wires.</li>
<li>2 Data IO.
<ul>
<li>MOSI - Master Out Slave In</li>
<li>MISO - Master In Slave Out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SCLK - Signal Clock for sync between components</li>
<li>SS - Slave Select for choosing which component to send and receive data to. Need one line for each component.</li>
<li>Lower overhead and higher data transfer speed.</li>
<li>Supports rates up to 10MHz or 10million bits per second</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i2c">I2C</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minimum of 2 wires(Not including power and ground)</li>
<li>SDA - Signal Data handles send and receive on one line</li>
<li>SCL - Signal Clock handles the syncing of data between devices</li>
<li>Higher overhead and lower data transfer speed.</li>
<li>Allows at most 1008 slave devices.</li>
<li>Is also a multi master system allowing multiple masters to access the same components. They must take turn however.</li>
<li>Sends an extra bit for every 8-bits sent</li>
<li>Can operate at up to 5MHz</li>
